    <h1><i>Samosa</i> recipe</h1>
    <img src="images/Punjabi-Samosa-4.jpg" alt="Samosa-image" width="1000">
    <h1><u>Description</u></h1>
    <p>A samosa is a fried or baked pastry with a savory filling, such as spiced potatoes, onions, peas, cheese, beef
        and other meats, or lentils. It may take different forms, including triangular, cone, or half-moon shapes,
        depending on the region. The Indian style, often accompanied by a mint chutney, is probably the most widely
        known of a broad family of recipes from Africa to China, which have origins in medieval times or earlier. </p>
    <h1><u>Ingredients</u></h1>
    <ul>
        <li>4 potatoes, peeled and cubed</li>
        <li>¼ cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 small onions, finely chopped</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons coriander seed</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon curry powder</li>
        <li>1 (1 inch) piece fresh ginger, grated</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground allspice</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>2 Roma (plum) tomatoes, finely chopped</li>
        <li>½ cup frozen peas</li>
        <li>2 (14.1 ounce) packages double-crust pie crusts, thawed
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h1><u>Instructions</u></h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce
            heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until just tender, about 15 minutes. Drain and allow to steam dry for
            a
            minute or two. Transfer to a large mixing bowl and refrigerate until cold.</li>
        <li>Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in the onions; cook and stir until the
            onion
            has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the coriander seed, curry powder, ginger, salt,
            turmeric, cumin, allspice, cayenne pepper, and cinnamon. Cook and stir for 2 minutes until the spices are
            fragrant. Add the tomatoes and cook until they begin to break down, about 5 minutes. Stir in the peas and
            cook
            for 2 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool to room temperature.</li>
        <li>Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Roll out one of the pie crusts on a floured work surface to about 1/8-inch thick. Cut into 6-inch rounds
            using a
            cookie cutter or the rim of a small bowl. Place a spoonful of the potato filling onto the center of each
            round.
            Moisten the edges with water, then fold in half to enclose the filling. Use a fork to press and seal the
            edges.
            Place onto the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining pie crusts and filling.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Serve hot or at room temperature.</li>
